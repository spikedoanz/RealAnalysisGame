# Level 5: Heine-Borel Theorem: Part 2b

**The Grand Finale**: We'll complete Heine-Borel by proving that any closed, bounded set is compact. The strategy is elegant: show that closed subsets of compact sets are compact, then use Level 4.

**New Lean Technology - Sum Types** 📦

Before diving into the proof, you need to master Lean's **disjoint union** (sum type):

**What is `α ⊕ β`?**: It's the \"either `α` or `β`\" type - every element is either from type `α` or from type `β`, but not both. Think of it as two boxes labeled \"Left\" and \"Right\":

`α ⊕ β = {Sum.inl a : a ∈ α} ∪ {Sum.inr b : b ∈ β}`

**Note**:
- `Sum.inl a` puts element `a : α` into the \"left\" side
- `Sum.inr b` puts element `b : β` into the \"right\" side

**Pattern Matching with `match`**: To make a function on a sum type, use `match`:

`let f : α ⊕ β → γ := fun x ↦
  match x with
  | Sum.inl a => ... -- handle the α case
  | Sum.inr b => ... -- handle the β case`

**Case Analysis with `cases`**: When arguing about where an element of a sum type came from, use `cases`:

`cases x with
| inl a => ... -- when x came from α
| inr b => ... -- when x came from β`

**Extracting Components**: If `s : Finset (α ⊕ β)`, then:
- `s.lefts : Finset α` extracts all the \"left\" elements
- `a ∈ s.lefts ↔ Sum.inl a ∈ s`

**Why Sum Types for This Proof?**

We need to handle TWO kinds of balls simultaneously:
1. **Original balls** (type `ι`) that cover our closed set `S`
2. **Avoidance balls** (type `Sᶜ`) that cover points outside `S`

The sum type `ι ⊕ Sᶜ` lets us create a unified covering system!

**The Strategy**:
1. Start with any covering of closed set `S ⊆ T` where `T` is compact
2. Since `S` is closed, `Sᶜ` is open - so each point in `Sᶜ` has a ball staying in `Sᶜ`
3. Use sum types to combine: original balls + avoidance balls = covering of all `T` (in fact, all of `ℝ`)
4. Apply compactness of `T` to get finite subcover
5. Extract just the \"left\" (original) balls to cover `S`, since avoidance balls don't touch `S`

**Your Mission**: Master sum types and use them to extend any covering of a closed subset to a covering of the whole compact set. This completes the Heine-Borel theorem!

Conclusion "
# 🎉 HEINE-BOREL THEOREM: COMPLETE! 🎉

You did it! You've just completed the proof of one of the most important theorems in all of mathematics:

**HEINE-BOREL THEOREM**: `S ⊆ ℝ is compact ⟺ S is closed and bounded`

**What You've Accomplished**:
- ✅ **Level 1**: Compact ⟹ Bounded
- ✅ **Level 2**: Compact ⟹ Closed
- ✅ **Level 3**: Least Upper Bound Property of ℝ
- ✅ **Level 4**: Closed Interval [a,b] is Compact
- ✅ **Level 5**: Closed Subset of Compact is Compact

**The Sum Type Mastery**: Your final proof showcased advanced Lean programming with sum types. You learned to:
- **Construct** disjoint unions `α ⊕ β`
- **Pattern match** with `match` and `cases`
- **Extract components** with `Finset.lefts`
- **Combine different index types** into unified covering systems

This isn't just theorem proving - it's sophisticated type-level programming!

**The Mathematical Journey**: You've traveled from elementary compactness through:
- **Topology** (open/closed sets, covers)
- **Real Analysis** (supremums, completeness of ℝ)
- **Logic** (proof by contradiction, case analysis)
- **Type Theory** (dependent types, sum types)

**Why This Theorem Changes Everything**:

🧮 **For Calculus**: Every continuous function on [a,b] is now guaranteed to be:
   - Uniformly continuous (by Level 23)
   - Integrable (Riemann sums converge)
   - Bounded and achieving max/min

📊 **For Analysis**: You can now easily check compactness just by verifying \"closed and bounded\" - no more wrestling with covers and subcovers!

🔬 **For Topology**: You've connected the abstract (compactness) with the concrete (closed + bounded), making topology applicable to real analysis.

**Historical Impact**: Your theorem unified 19th-century analysis. Before Heine (1872) and Borel (1895), mathematicians had intuitions about why [a,b] was special but couldn't prove it rigorously.

**The Complete Chain**: You can now trace the full logical chain:

`f continuous on [a,b] → [a,b] compact (Heine-Borel)
                     → f uniformly continuous (Level 23)
                     → f integrable (Level 23)`

**Looking Forward**: You've built the foundation for advanced analysis - measure theory, functional analysis, and differential geometry all build on compactness.

You've just proved one of the crown jewels of mathematics! Take a moment to appreciate the elegant interplay of topology, analysis, and logic you've mastered. 🏆

Welcome to the ranks of real analysts!
