# Level 3: Least Upper Bound Property

**The Big Picture**: We're taking a detour into the deep structure of ℝ itself. To prove that closed bounded sets are compact, we need a fundamental property (that does not hold for ℚ!): **every bounded set has a supremum**.

**New Definitions**:
- **Upper Bound**: `IsUB S (M : ℝ) := ∀ s ∈ S, s ≤ M`
  - `M` sits above every point in `S`
- **Least Upper Bound**: `IsLUB S L := IsUB S L ∧ ∀ M, IsUB S M → L ≤ M`
  - `L` is an upper bound, and no smaller number is an upper bound

**The Proof Strategy - Bisection**:
We'll construct a sequence of nested intervals `[aₙ, bₙ]` that shrink to the supremum. Here's where Lean's **dependent types** shine:

`let ab : ∀ (n : ℕ), {p : ℝ × ℝ //
  (p.1 ∈ S) ∧ IsUB S p.2 ∧ p.1 ≤ p.2 ∧ p.2 - p.1 ≤ (M - s₀) / 2^n}`

This type says: \"For each `n`, give me a pair `(aₙ, bₙ)` such that:
- `aₙ ∈ S` (so the left endpoint is achievable)
- `bₙ` is an upper bound for `S`
- `aₙ ≤ bₙ` (it's a valid interval)
- The interval length shrinks by half each time\"

**The Inductive Construction**:
- **Base case**: Start with the `s₀ ∈ S` guaranteed by nonemptyness of `S`, and given upper bound `M`
- **Inductive step**: Given interval `[aₙ, bₙ]`, look at midpoint `m = (aₙ + bₙ)/2`
  - If `m` is an upper bound for `S`, set `[aₙ₊₁, bₙ₊₁] = [aₙ, m]`
  - If not, find some `s ∈ S` with `s > m`, set `[aₙ₊₁, bₙ₊₁] = [s, bₙ]`

**Dependent Types Magic**: The type system *guarantees* that our construction maintains all necessary properties at each step. We're not just building sequences - we're building sequences *with proofs* that they satisfy our constraints!

**Your Mission**: Implement this bisection algorithm and prove that the limit sequences converge to the least upper bound of `S`.

Conclusion "
# You've Just Proved ℝ is Complete!

Congratulations! You've just established one of the most fundamental properties of the real numbers: the **Least Upper Bound Property**. This is
another way to say that `ℝ` is \"complete\" - it has no gaps.

**What Made This Proof Special**:
- **Dependent Types Power**: Your proof showcased Lean's dependent type system at its best. The type `ℕ → {p : ℝ × ℝ // ...}` didn't just give you pairs of reals - it gave you pairs *with built-in proofs* that they satisfy all your constraints, and depend on the `n : ℕ`.
- **Constructive Algorithm**: Your bisection method doesn't just prove a supremum exists - it gives you an algorithm to compute it to arbitrary precision!
- **Induction on Steroids**: You weren't just proving a property for all `n` - you were constructing a sequence where each element depends on satisfying complex constraints involving the previous ones.

**Why This Property is Profound**:
- **`ℚ` Fails Here**: The rationals are missing \"limit points\" like √2. Your proof shows ℝ has no such gaps.
- **Topology Connection**: Completeness (LUB property) is what makes compact sets in ℝ so well-behaved.
- **Analysis Foundation**: Virtually every major theorem in real analysis depends on this completeness property.

**The Nested Interval Magic**: Your proof created intervals `[aₙ, bₙ]` with three beautiful properties:
1. Each `aₙ ∈ S` (reachable from below)
2. Each `bₙ` is an upper bound (unreachable from `S`)
3. `bₙ - aₙ → 0` (they squeeze together)

The limit of this squeeze is exactly the supremum!

**What's Coming**: Armed with the LUB property, you're now ready for the hard part of Heine-Borel. In Level 4, you'll prove that closed intervals `[a,b]` are compact. This will use your LUB property in a sophisticated way to show that any open cover can be reduced to a finite subcover.

**Historical Note**: This property was one of the last pieces needed to make calculus rigorous. Weierstrass, Dedekind, and Cantor all worked on different ways to construct ℝ with this completeness property in the 1870s.

You've just proved one of the crown jewels of real analysis! 👑
