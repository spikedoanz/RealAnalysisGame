# Level 2: Leibniz Series — Convergence

In the previous level, you proved that the partial sums have an explicit formula:
`∑ k ∈ range n, a k = 1 - 1 / (n + 1)`

Now it's time to prove rigorously that the infinite series **converges**.

## What We Need to Show

To prove `SeriesConv a`, we need to show that the sequence of partial sums converges to some limit `L`.

From the formula, it's clear that the limit should be `L = 1`, since:
`lim (n → ∞) [1 - 1/(n+1)] = 1 - 0 = 1`

But we need to prove this using the **ε-N definition** of convergence!

## The ε-N Challenge

We must show: for every `ε > 0`, there exists `N` such that for all `n ≥ N`:
`|∑ k ∈ range n, a k - 1| < ε`

Using the partial sum formula, this becomes:
`|(1 - 1/(n+1)) - 1| < ε`

Simplifying: `|−1/(n+1)| = 1/(n+1) < ε`

So we need: **given ε > 0, find N such that for all n ≥ N, we have 1/(n+1) < ε**.

## The Key Tool: Archimedean Property

This is exactly what the **Archimedean Property** gives us! It says that for any `ε > 0`, there exists `N` such that `1/N < ε`.

Then for all `n ≥ N`, we have:
`1/(n+1) ≤ 1/n ≤ 1/N < ε`

## Your Task

Prove that `SeriesConv a` using:
- The explicit formula from Level 1 (`LeibnizSeriesFinite`)
- The Archimedean Property (`ArchProp`)
- Careful inequality reasoning to show `1/(n+1) < ε`

**Hint:** After using `ArchProp` to get your `N`, you'll need to do some work showing that `1/(n+1) ≤ 1/n ≤ 1/N < ε`. The tactics `field_simp` and `bound` will be your friends!

Conclusion "
Excellent work! You've rigorously proven that the Leibniz series converges to 1.

## What You've Accomplished

**Theorem (LeibnizSeries):** The series `∑ k, 1/((k+1)(k+2))` converges.

More precisely, you've shown that `SeriesConv a` holds, meaning the partial sums converge to the limit `L = 1`.

## The Proof Structure

Your proof had three main ingredients:

1. **The explicit formula** from Level 1: `∑ k ∈ range n, a k = 1 - 1/(n+1)`

2. **The Archimedean Property:** Given `ε > 0`, there exists `N` with `1/N < ε`

3. **Inequality chaining:** For `n ≥ N`:
   `1/(n+1) ≤ 1/n ≤ 1/N < ε`

The combination of these three ingredients gave you the ε-N proof that the partial sums approach 1!

## Understanding the Convergence

The series converges quite quickly. After `n` terms, the partial sum differs from the limit by only `1/(n+1)`:

- After 10 terms: error ≈ 0.091
- After 100 terms: error ≈ 0.0099
- After 1000 terms: error ≈ 0.001

This `O(1/n)` convergence rate is typical for telescoping series.

## The Role of the Archimedean Property

The Archimedean Property was crucial! It guaranteed that `1/N` can be made smaller than any positive `ε`, no matter how tiny. This is what allowed us to control the tail `1/(n+1)`.

Without completeness and the Archimedean property, we couldn't have this guarantee. In fact, this property fails in non-Archimedean ordered fields!

## From Formula to Convergence

This level demonstrated a powerful two-step strategy:
1. **First**, find an explicit formula for partial sums (often via telescoping, induction, or other techniques)
2. **Then**, use the formula to prove convergence rigorously

This approach is cleaner than trying to prove convergence directly without knowing what the limit is!

## Historical Context

Leibniz studied this and similar series in the 1670s as part of his groundbreaking work on infinite series. He didn't have our modern ε-N definition (that came 150 years later with Cauchy), but his intuition about these sums was remarkably accurate.

**Next level:** We'll prove a comparison theorem that lets us bound one series by another, setting up powerful convergence tests!
