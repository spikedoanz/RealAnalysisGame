# Level 1: Continuous Composition

Welcome to our first exploration of function composition in the context of continuity! After spending considerable time understanding the nuances of uniform convergence and why pointwise convergence fails to preserve continuity, let's start with something reassuring: some properties of continuous functions are indeed well-behaved.

## The Beautiful Truth

**Theorem `Cont_Comp`**: The composition of continuous functions is continuous.

This might seem \"obvious\" from your calculus intuition, but as we've learned, intuition can be misleading in analysis. The beauty of this theorem lies not just in its truth, but in how cleanly the proof works—it's a perfect example of the `ε-δ` method in action.

## Why This Matters

Think about it: every time you write something like $\\sin(\\cos(x))$ or $e^{x^2}$ or $(x^2 + 1)^{3/2}$, you're implicitly using this theorem. Without it, we'd have to verify continuity from scratch for every composite function we encounter!

## The Intuitive Picture

If $g$ is continuous at $x$, then small changes in $x$ produce small changes in $g(x)$. If $f$ is continuous at $g(x)$, then small changes in $g(x)$ produce small changes in $f(g(x))$. Chain these together: small changes in $x$ lead to small changes in $(f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$.

But remember—intuition must be backed by rigorous proof!

## The Strategy

The proof is a beautiful example of the \"intermediate tolerance\" technique:

1. **Engineer demands**: $|(f \\circ g)(x) - (f \\circ g)(c)| < \\varepsilon$
2. **We rewrite**: This means $|f(g(x)) - f(g(c))| < \\varepsilon$
3. **Use $f$'s continuity**: Find $\\varepsilon_1 > 0$ such that $|y - g(c)| < \\varepsilon_1 \\Rightarrow |f(y) - f(g(c))| < \\varepsilon$
4. **Use $g$'s continuity**: Find $\\delta > 0$ such that $|x - c| < \\delta \\Rightarrow |g(x) - g(c)| < \\varepsilon_1$
5. **Chain them**: If $|x - c| < \\delta$, then $|g(x) - g(c)| < \\varepsilon_1$, so $|f(g(x)) - f(g(c))| < \\varepsilon$

## A Moment of Appreciation

This theorem works so smoothly because we have complete control over both levels of approximation. Compare this to what happens with pointwise convergence—there, the \"inner\" approximation (how quickly $f_n$ approaches $F$) happens at different rates at different points, breaking our ability to chain the estimates uniformly.

## Your Challenge

Prove that if $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $g : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ are continuous, then $f \\circ g$ is continuous.

**Lean signature**: `FunCont f → FunCont g → FunCont (f ∘ g)`

# Level 1 Conclusion: The Power of Chaining Estimates

Congratulations! You've just completed one of the most elegant proofs in real analysis. Let's take a moment to appreciate what you've accomplished and what it teaches us about mathematical reasoning.

## What You Just Proved

You proved that **composition preserves continuity**—a fundamental building block that underlies much of calculus and analysis. Every time you differentiate $\\sin(x^2)$ or integrate $e^{\\sqrt{x}}$, you're relying on this theorem.

## The Beauty of the Method

Notice how the proof worked through a beautiful chain of estimates:
- We **decomposed** the problem: instead of directly controlling $|f(g(x)) - f(g(c))|$, we introduced an intermediate step
- We **chained** two separate continuity arguments: first $g$'s continuity, then $f$'s continuity
- We **controlled** the error propagation by carefully choosing our intermediate tolerance $\\varepsilon_1$

This \"intermediate variable\" technique is a fundamental proof strategy that appears throughout analysis.

## The Deeper Lesson

Compare this success to the failure we saw with pointwise convergence in the introduction. Why does composition work so cleanly while pointwise limits of continuous functions can be discontinuous?

**The key difference**: In function composition, we have **uniform control** over both levels of approximation. When we use $g$'s continuity to get $|g(x) - g(c)| < \\varepsilon_1$, this bound works the same way regardless of which specific values $x$ and $c$ take. There's no \"rate of convergence\" that varies from point to point.

This is a preview of why **uniform convergence** (coming next!) is so much more powerful than pointwise convergence.

## Looking Ahead: The Plot Thickens

You might be thinking: \"That was straightforward! Continuous functions behave nicely after all.\"

Well, not so fast. In the next level, you'll see that even though individual continuous functions compose nicely, **sequences** of continuous functions can behave in surprising ways. The very fact that we needed to introduce \"uniform convergence\" as a concept hints that pointwise convergence—which seems natural—is somehow insufficient.

## A Technical Note

In your proof, you likely used the `choose` tactic to extract the $\\varepsilon_1$ and $\\delta$ values from the continuity hypotheses. This is exactly the right approach! The `choose` tactic is perfect for extracting witnesses from existential statements, and continuity definitions are full of such statements.

## Mathematical Maturity Milestone

By completing this proof, you've demonstrated several key aspects of mathematical maturity:
- **Strategic thinking**: You planned a multi-step proof approach
- **Technical precision**: You managed multiple quantifiers and logical dependencies
- **Conceptual understanding**: You see how continuity at one level enables continuity at another level

## Final Thought

Function composition works because continuous functions \"play nicely\" with each other in a very precise sense. This harmony doesn't always extend to infinite processes, as we'll see. But when it does work, as here, the mathematics has an almost musical quality—each step flowing naturally into the next.

Ready for the next challenge? The uniform convergence theorem awaits, and it's going to test everything you've learned about the delicate relationship between limits and continuity.

Well done! 🎯
