# Level 1: Big Boss - Product of Sequences

This is the capstone of the Algebraic Limit Theorem! We've already proven that limits behave well under addition, scalar multiplication, and inversion. Now we tackle multiplication of sequences.

**The Challenge:** If `a n → L` and `b n → M`, prove that `a n * b n → L * M`.

**The Key Insight:** We need to write the error `a n * b n - L * M` in a way that separates the contributions from each sequence. The trick is to add and subtract `b n * L`:

```
a n * b n - L * M = (a n - L) * b n + L * (b n - M)
```

**Why does this work?** Think about rectangles! The product `a n * b n` is the area of a rectangle with dimensions `a n` by `b n`, while `L * M` is the limiting rectangle. The difference decomposes into two strips:
- `(a n - L) * b n`: a thin vertical strip (small width, bounded height)
- `L * (b n - M)`: a thin horizontal strip (bounded width, small height)

The corner piece `(a n - L) * (b n - M)` gets absorbed into the first term—it's doubly small so it doesn't hurt us!

**The Strategy:**
1. Use `Bdd_of_ConvNonzero` to get a bound `K` on the sequence `b`
2. Make `|a n - L| < ε/(2*K)` to control the first term
3. Make `|b n - M| < ε/(2*|L|)` to control the second term
4. Combine using the triangle inequality


Good luck!

If sequences `a b : ℕ → ℝ` converge with `a` going to `L ≠ 0` and `b` going to `M ≠ 0`, then `a n * b n` converges to `L * M`.

Conclusion "
Congratulations! You've completed the hardest part of the Algebraic Limit Theorem.

Postscript:
**Why would you think to add and subtract `b n * L`?**

Think about the product rule in calculus: `(fg)' = f'g + fg'`. Multiplication always corresponds to a rectangle. When you have two quantities `f` and `g` both changing, the change in their product `fg` can be visualized as the change in area:

```
      f        Δf
   +-----+-------+
   |     |       |
 g |     |       |
   +-----+-------+
 Δg|     |  tiny |
   +-----+-------+
```

The total change is `(f + Δf)(g + Δg) - fg = f·Δg + g·Δf + Δf·Δg`.

In our proof, we replaced `M` with `b n` (adding and subtracting `b n * L`) to get the same decomposition. The `Δf·Δg` term (the tiny corner) gets absorbed into `(a n - L) * b n`, and since both factors are small, it doesn't cause problems.

This geometric picture explains the algebraic trick: we're decomposing the area difference into two manageable strips that we can control independently.

# Algebraic Limit Theorem - Complete!

You can now:
- **Add** sequences: if `a n → L` and `b n → M`, then `a n + b n → L + M`
- **Multiply by constants**: if `a n → L`, then `c * a n → c * L`
- **Multiply** sequences: if `a n → L` and `b n → M`, then `a n * b n → L * M`
- **Invert** (when limit is nonzero): if `a n → L ≠ 0`, then `1 / a n → 1 / L`

This is incredibly powerful! For any algebraic combination of convergent sequences, you can compute the limit by just plugging in the individual limits.

**Example:** If `a n → L` and `b n → M`, what is
```
lim ((a n)² + 2*a n + b n) / (3*b n + 2 - (a n)²)
```

**Answer:** `(L² + 2*L + M) / (3*M + 2 - L²)` (provided the denominator ≠ 0).

You can build this up step by step using the algebraic limit rules!

**Note:** The case where `L = 0` or `M = 0` is left as an exercise. The proof requires slightly different techniques since you can't divide by `|L|` or ensure `b` is bounded away from zero. Try it yourself!
